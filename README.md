# Research-Bipartite-Matching-Problem

### To do: Maximal Matching Algorithm

Build a bipartite matching algorithm in python -- maximal bipartite matching. 

Steps: 
Define a graph

1 set of keys from table a. one set of keys from table b. 

the other set would describe the relationship between the tables (weighted relationship). 

Any possible match can be an edge in this graph

## Tasks after Meeting 03.25.2020

### Generalize the code to 

1. Allow for an arbitrary weight function to handle both maximum and minimum 

2. Allow to be given two dataframes, and a function that gives the correspondence
