# Research-Bipartite-Matching-Problem

### To do: Maximal Matching Algorithm

Build a bipartite matching algorithm in python -- maximal bipartite matching. 

Steps: 
Define a graph in terms of python dictionary. 

1 set of keys from table a. one set of keys from table b. 

the other set would describe the relationship between the tables (weighted relationship). 

Any possible match can be an edge in this graph
